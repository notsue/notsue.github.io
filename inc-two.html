[h3 Includes ]
[ This is [code inc-two.html ] speaking. A lot has been written about HTML and 'includes' (as is well known in LaTeX ). Many ideas have been developed to imitate
 an include-system in HTML (php, JavaScript, ... ). We think that a good mechanism
 needs server-side scripting, and therefore a server. But then we are no longer
 simply writing HTML-documents, which can be served and exchanged everywhere.]
