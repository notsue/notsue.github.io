[h3 But It Is Hypertext! ]

[ There is an old trick to assemble multiple files in one html-document. 
  Create a 'list' of links to these files and use as value of their target the name of an iframe. The links serve as buttons to select one of the 'includes'.
  They are not realy 'includes', but HTML is after all different from LaTeX. The
  later is used to create a text from begin to the end (linear). HTML is used
  to create [b hypertext] which is not linear. The 'old trick' is here applied in pure [i haha ].There is no JavaScript involved, only some extra css in [i haha.css ].]

[ [i haha] is not meant as a tool to create websites or Content Managemant Systems. But at the same time, notes and ideas often need a nice presentation, with links, footnotes, table of contents, etc. HTML is ok, but even in a HTML-editor, it takes too much effort to create elements with attributes. [i haha] is designed to be both simple and at the same time not limited qua HTML-production. The user should know only some basic general rules, which are applied in every element and all attributes. ]
