[,dc.description [a,https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css Tufte CSS ] provides tools to style web articles using the ideas demonstrated by Edward Tufte’s books and handouts. The [a,https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/ live version ] is the best overview of the project.  ] 
    
[ Tufte’s style is known for its simplicity, extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and carefully chosen typography. [em Tufte CSS ] was created by [a,http://www.daveliepmann.com Dave Liepmann ]. ]
    
[ The [a,https://github.com/notsue/HaHa haha project ] tested [em Tufte CSS ] and it's corresponding HTML document structure. A small css-correction had to be made in our [code haha.css ] for the table of contents, to avoid decoration of the links by  [em Tufte CSS.] ]

[h2 Getting Started ]

	[ [span,newthought Who is Edward Tufte? ] What is [em Tufte CSS ]? You get many answers when you read the [a,https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/ live Tufte CSS ] of Dave Liepmann.  Here we assume that you've read this, and we focus on the haha-implementation. ]
    
    [ We start with a haha-template, demonstrating the main structure of the HTML-document. Learn by doing. ]

<pre><code>
&lt;html dir="ltr" lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /&gt;

[ You can always look at the source of this webpage, in order to see how [em Tufte CSS ] is used in haha-markup. ]

[ul
[ In the head of the HTML-file we load [code haha.js, tufte.css ] from [a,https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css GitHub/Tufte CSS ] and our [code haha.css ]. ]
[ The main structure of the body is an <code>article</code>-element with 
<code>section</code>-elements. Preceding the first section we have a 
<code>h1</code>-header and an optional [code   p,subtitle ] ] 
[ A section can but must not have a [code h2 ]-heading. [em Tufte CSS ] uses [code h3 ] for low-level headings. More specific headings are not supported. ]
[ Here we placed a table of contents after the first section, which serves as intoduction. ]
[ Tufte starts each section with the first few words of the sentence set in small caps. For this [em Tufte CSS ] uses a [code span ] with the class [code newthought ] ]
[ Tufte CSS does not touch header- en footer-elements which are direct children of body. [em tufte.css ] might provide some header-styling. ]

[h2 Sidenotes &amp; Margin Notes ]

[ [span,newthought One of the most distinctive features ] of Tufte’s style is his extensive use of sidenotes 
    [SN,sn-example-sidenote This is a sidenote. Sidenotes are like footnotes, except they 
    don’t force the reader to jump their eye to the bottom of the page. ].
    On sufficiently large viewports, Tufte CSS uses the margin for sidenotes, margin notes, and small figures. On smaller viewports, elements that would go in the margin are hidden until the user toggles them into view. ]

[ haha uses JavaScript to facilitate the use of sidenotes and margin notes. The JavaScript (part of [i haha.js ]) produces HTML which is equivalent to
    the HTML produced by following haha-code, which follows step by step the sidenote-HTML of [em Tufte CSS ]. ]
	
<pre><code class="language-html">
[ text ...
[label,margin-toggle_sidenote-number,for=sn-example-sidenote ]
[input,type=checkbox,class=margin-toggle,id=sn-example-sidenote ] 
[span,sidenote ...text of sidenote ...]
... more text ]

</code></pre>

 [ But with [i haha.js ] this can be reduced to: ]

<pre><code class="language-html">
[ text ... 
[SN,sn-example-sidenote ...text of sidenote ... ] 
... more text ]

</code></pre>

[ Same procedure for a margin note, now using tag [code MN ]. ]

<pre><code class="language-lisp">
[ text ... 
[MN,test-mn-haha ...text of margin note ... ] 
... more text ]

</code></pre>

[ Demo (change width of browser screen, to see the effect)
    [MN This is a margin note. Notice there isn't a number preceding the note. ].
 On large screens, a margin note omits the reference number. On small screens, a margin note is like a sidenote 
 except its viewability-toggle is a symbol rather than a reference number. haha uses the symbol [span,margin-toggle &#8314; ]. Liepmann uses &#8853;. We've tried creating some similarity between numbered and anonymous notes. ]

    [ If you’d like to introduce your page or a section of your page with some quotes, use epigraphs. These are [code blockquote ] elements, 
    children of a block [code \[div,epigraph \] ]. The source goes of a quote goes in a [code footer ] element inside the [code blockquote ]. 
    Following haha-markup implements shorter and longer quotes (with and without a paragraph tag) and shows how multiple quotes within an epigraph fit 
    together with the use of wrapper class [code epigraph ].  ]

[blockquote
[ \[It is\] notable that the Feynman lectures (3 volumes) write about all of physics in 1800 pages, using only 2 levels of hierarchical headings: chapters and A-level heads in the text. It also uses the methodology of [em sentences ] which then cumulate sequentially into [em paragraphs ], rather than the grunts of bullet points. Undergraduate Caltech physics is very complicated material, but it didn’t require an elaborate hierarchy to organize. ]

[h2,id=figures Figures ]

    [ We are still using content from Liepmann's [a,https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css Tufte CSS ] 
	to demonstate figures. Look at the source of this webpage to see haha-markup. ] 
    [ Figures should try to use the [code figure ] element, which by default are constrained to the 
	  main column. Don’t wrap figures in a paragraph tag. Any label or margin note goes in a regular 
	  margin note inside the figure. For example, most of the time one should introduce a figure 
	  directly into the main flow of discussion. ] 
    
	[figure
      [MN,mn-exports-imports From Edward Tufte, [em Visual Display of Quantitative Information ], page 92. ]

    Ashworth Underwood, 337-356. From page 71 of Edward Tufte’s [em Visual Explanations ]. ] 
    But tight integration of graphics with text is central to Tufte’s work even when those graphics are ancillary 
    to the main body of a text. In many of those cases, a margin figure may be most appropriate. To place 
    figures in the margin, just wrap an image (or whatever) in a margin note inside a [code p ] tag, as seen 
    to the right of this paragraph. ] 
    
    [ If you need a full-width figure, give it the [code fullwidth ] class. Make sure that’s inside an [code article ], and it
    will take up (almost) the full width of the screen. This approach is demonstrated below using Edward Tufte’s 
    English translation of the Napoleon’s March data visualization. From [em Beautiful Evidence ], page 122-124. ]

    ]
    
    [ One obstacle to creating elegant figures on the web is the difficulty of handling different screen sizes, especially on the fly. Embedded [code iframe ] elements are particularly troublesome. For these instances [em Tufte CSS ] wraps the element [code \[iframe ] in a [code \[figure,iframe-wrapper ].  ]
    [ You can use [code div ] instead of [code figure ], with slightly different results but the same general effect. ]
