[h3 Why [i haha] ? ]

[  [i haha] was created as a tool to facilitate writing of html, especially in a context where the author creates documents with some notes, ideas, ... Iframes can help to order the content in tree-like structure. ]

[ This is [code inc-one.html ] speaking. All content of the body-element
is [code haha markup ]. The src-document must have its own [i haha.js ]. We use again [code simple.css ] and [code haha.css ] (which also contains the styling of our
iframe) [FN Yes, we can insert footnotes here as well. ]. ] 

[ A link to [a,inc-two.html inc-two.html ]. You can use the browsers back-arrow to
return. Or you can use button 1 of our menu. ]

[ You only have to reload the content of the the iframe if a file has changed (that is: press the button of that file). Not the main page with the iframe-element. ]
